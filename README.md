# Ideal-Gas-Sim

An ideal gas simulator that I whipped up in FORTRAN in a few days as my first big project in the language. Simulates a 2D box of ideally behaving particles, and calculates the pressure based off of the mean force on the box.
As far as I can tell, it gets the pressure about 60-80% right. Not sure where to improve the code in order to improve simulation results. I'm unsure if the simulation is off due to the fact that it is only 2D.

#Running the Simulation
Go to the I/O folder, and open input.txt. Here, you can change the simulation conditions freely before you begin. Once done, just run sim.exe to start! The results will populate into output.txt.
